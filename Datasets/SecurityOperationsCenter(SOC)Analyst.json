This resets the BIOS settings, including the password. Alternatively, use the BIOS jumper on the motherboard to reset the BIOS password. For laptops, due to integrated security measures, you may need to use the manufacturer's backdoor password or a hardware reset sequence, like a hidden reset button or a specific key combination during boot."
