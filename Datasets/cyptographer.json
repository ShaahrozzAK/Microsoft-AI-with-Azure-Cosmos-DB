      "content": "Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. Its main goals are:\nConfidentiality: Ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized parties.\nIntegrity: Ensuring that information is not altered or tampered with.\nAuthentication: Verifying the identity of the parties involved in communication.\nNon-repudiation: Ensuring that a sender cannot deny sending a message.\nImportant Points:\nConfidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation"

It is fast and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data but requires secure key exchange.\nAsymmetric Cryptography: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. It is more secure for key exchange but slower and computationally intensive.\nImportant Points:\nSymmetric: same key for encryption/decryption, fast, requires secure key exchange\nAsymmetric: public/private key pair, secure key exchange, slower"

If they match, the message is authentic and unaltered.\nImportant Points:\nEnsures authenticity and integrity\nSigning: hash and private key\nVerification: public key and hash comparison"
